# AWS Services for Containers

* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Elastic Beanstalk Containers - PaaS
* Docker EE for AWS
* Relational Database Service (RDS)


---

## EC2

Do It Yourself approach

* Amazon Linux or other AMI + Docker Engine
* Docker image (AMI)

* CloudFormation, AWS CLI or web console
* User Data to install Docker Engine

---

## ECS

Managed container service

* Monitors containers
* Allows ELB
* Allows autoscaling
* Allows health checks

---

## ECR

Storage for container images which can be used with EC2, ECS or other services

---

## Elastic BeanStack

PaaS

Ideal for small services with few containers.

---

## Docker EE

Comprehensive CloudFormation blueprint

---

# RDS

Can be used with other services. Allows for managed databases.

---

## Let's cover ECS + ECR usage


---

## AWS EC2 Container Services

* Tasks
* Clusters
* Registries

---

## Registry

Where developers store their images. Allows for versioning and tagging.

---

## Task

Task definition has info about images, env vars and network.

---

## Cluster

Container cluster is like an EC2 instance where containers run.

---

## Service

Container service makes sure your containers from task are running in a cluster. ELB and autoscaling group can be added to a service.

# AWS is vast

You should have Elastic Load Balancer, multi-availability zone deployment, Continuos Delivery S3, and managed database services.

Learn more about AWS by taking [AWS Intro](node.university/p/aws-intro) and [AWS Intermediate](node.university/p/aws-intermediate)

---

# Demo 💻

Deployment using ECR and EC2 ECS.

---

# Lab 2: AWS Containers


Task: Deploy two containers (API and DB) which connect using ECR and EC2 ECS.

Detailed instructions and link are in labs/2-installs.md
