Here are some of the benefits of Docker containers:

* Allow for rapid application development/deployment
* Allow consistent behavior from dev to production, i.e., portable across machines & environments - fewer bugs!
* Extendable (reuse, collaboration + community)
* Lightweight and fast (no guest OS)
* Easy to collaborate, use and maintain
* Can be versioned and components can be reused

---

## Container Terminology

---

# Docker Images

Images – The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. We will use the docker pull command to download the specified image.

---

# Docker Containers

Containers – Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using docker run. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.

---

# Docker Daemon

Docker Daemon – The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operation system to which clients talk to. It is what makes Docker Engine work.

---

# Docker Client

Docker Client – The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. There can be other forms of clients – such as Kitematic which provides a GUI.

---

# Docker Hub

Docker Hub – A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.

---

# Dockerfile

Dockerfile – A recipe from which you can create an image. Dockerfile has the base image, instructions to add or copy files, commands to execute, ports to expose and other information. Dockerfile is case sensitive.

---

# Docker Compose

Docker Compose – A mechanism to orchestrate multiple containers needed for a service(s) from a single configuration file docker-compose.yml.

---

# Host

Host – Your computer which hosts docker daemon or a remote machine which hosts docker deamon/engine.

---

## Docker workflow

1. Code and create Dockerfile
1. Build an image, tag it, upload to registry (optional)
1. Run container from an image with env vars, volumes and networks
1. Re-build and re-run if needed
1. Stop container

---

## Base Images

---

## Plain OS Base Images:

* [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)
* [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)
* [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and jessie (debian v8)
* [centos](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/)
* [amazonlinux](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux)

---

## Environment-Ready Base Images

* [node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) v7.9 is based on buildpack-deps:jessie
* node:alpine v6 is based on alpine
* [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) v1.13 is based on debian:stretch-slim
* Apache [httpd](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd) v2.2 is based on debian:jessie
* [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) v3 is based on debian:wheezy-slim
* [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) v9 is based on debian:jessie

---


## Dockerfile

Blueprint for the images which turn into containers

---


# Main statements

* FROM
* RUN
* WORKDIR
* COPY
* EXPOSE
* CMD

---

## Creating an Image

---

Create an image from the current project folder:

```
docker build .
```

Create an image with a name and a tag:

```
docker build -t {your-name}/{your-app-name}:{tag} .
```

---


---


## Installing and Running Docker

---

## `docker run`

Some useful options to the docker run command are:

- `-d` will detach our terminal (bg/daemon).
- `-rm` will remove the container after running.
- `-it` attaches an interactive tty in the container.
- `-p` will publish/expose ports for our container.
- `--name` a name for our container.
- `-v` mounts a volume to share between host and container.
- `-e` provides environment vars to the container.

`docker run --help` for all flags

---

Run Alpine and execute `echo` in it:

```
docker run alpine echo "hello from alpine"
```

Run Ubuntu and use tty in the container:

```
docker run -it ubuntu
```

---

## Dockerfile Hello World example


Project folder structure:

```
/docker-node-hello
  Dockerfile
  server.js  
```


---

## Main app file

server.js:

```
const port = 3000
require('http')
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log('url:', req.url)
    res.end('hello world')
  })
  .listen(port, (error)=>{
    console.log(`server is running on ${port}`)
  })
```

---

# Hello World Dockerfile

Dockerfile:

```
FROM node:6-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY server.js /usr/src/app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```


---


Build the image:

```
docker build .
```

---
```
docker build .

---

Verify and copy newly built image ID:

```
docker images
```

![inline](images/docker-images.png)                  

---

Run with mapping ports host:container:

```
docker run -p 80:3000 {image-id}
```
For example:

```
docker run -p 80:3000 a1888c63ecfb
```

Output (from container):

```
server is running on 3000
```

---

Verify "Hello world" in new terminal session.

```
curl http://localhost
```

or in the browser: <http://localhost>


![right 50%](images/hello-world.png)

Remember port 80 is the default port value for HTTP so no need to type it in the URL.

---

Also, verify with Docker Engine:

```
docker ps
```

Output example:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES

```

---


Stop:

```
docker stop {image-id}
```

For example:

```
docker stop 19b4df5a399c
```

---

## Congrats, you've run your first Node web server in a container.


---


## Working with containers

The ps will show you a list of all containers that we’ve run on the development machine (called host):

```
docker ps -a
```

Currently running containers:

```
docker ps
```

Remove

```
docker rm {container-id}
```

---

## Remove all containers and images ⚠️

Delete all locally stopped containers

```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

Delete all local images

```
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

❗ No way to restore them! ❗

---

## Remove all containers and images ⚠️


One (newer) command to remove unused images, stopped containers, etc. ❗ No way to restore them! ❗

```
docker system prune -a
```

```
WARNING! This will remove:
	- all stopped containers
	- all volumes not used by at least one container
	- all networks not used by at least one container
	- all images without at least one container associated to them
```

---

## ❔ How do you connect to a database, make container flexible so it acts in different environments differently? ❔

---

# You need to use environment variables! (See module 2.)

---

## Variables, arguments and other parameters

* ARG in Dockerfile: built-time arguments which can be used in Dockerfile and supplied with `docker build --build-args` CLI
* ENV in Dockerfile: hard-coded in Dockerfile environment variables so it becomes baked into an image
* Environment variables with `docker run -e`: not-hard-coded, run-time and supplied with CLI
* RUN with environment variables, e.g., `RUN NODE_ENV=production npm i` - same as ENV in Dockerfile

---

## ARG vs ENV

ARG and ENV are baked into images but ARG can be modified on built with `docker build --build-args`

---

## Yet more Dockerfile Statements

* ADD
* LABEL
* VOLUME
* ENTRYPOINT (must have CMD or ENTRYPOINT)
* USER

---

## COPY vs ADD

ADD can fetch from URLs and unzip[^1]

---

# ENTRYPOINT vs CMD


CMD provides default commands. ENTRYPOINT command options will always run, but CMD can be overwritten by `docker run` [^2]. ENTRYPOINT can be supplemented by CMD options:

```
ENTRYPOINT ["node"]
CMD [ "server.js" ]
```

[^2]: http://goinbigdata.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint

---

# What to use

CMD is recommended for service-based images (like an API)[^3], e.g.,

```
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

---

## Development with Docker

Two things in container: environment (not changing often) and app (changes often - every time you press save).

Source code change->Image Rebuild? 😞

---

# Use volumes!

---

You can attach and detach volumes. Volumes allow sharing of data in the run-time between host and container.

* No need to rebuild an image each time you make a change
* Use the same image for development as for production
* Share data between containers

```
docker run -v $(pwd)/:/www/ {image-id}
docker run -v $(pwd)/app:/usr/src/app -it {name}
```

`$(pwd)` is the print working directory (absolute path to the location from which you run this command)

---

## How to use the same image in production?

---

## Use pm2 for dev and production

1. Use `docker run -v $(pwd)/api:/usr/src/api -e NODE_ENV=development {image-id}` to pass environment variable and attach volume
1. Install pm2 and run `npm start` in Dockerfile
1. Use if/else in `npm start` which will run `pm2-dev`
1. Any file changes on host will trigger restart in container

---

# If/else in npm start script

This is just a shell if/else in the npm script start in package.json:

```
"start": "if [[ ${NODE_ENV} = production ]]; then pm2-docker start -i 0 server.js; else pm2-dev server.js; fi"
```

---

# Recommended for Dockering Node

* Keep container single-concerned, ephemeral and stateless
* `FROM node:6-alpine`
* File restart
* `npm i --production`
* Environment variable


---

# Recommended for Dockering Node

* Use volumes and the network
* Keep layers minimal (RUN create a layer)
* Use COPY and CMD
* Use if/else but sparingly

---


# Multilple containers with Docker networks

---

# Each container should have only one concern

The best practice for containers is to have one app per container. Often times, developers will want and need to connect two or more containers together. For example, Node API and MongoDB.


---

## One Network allows sharing of connections between containers

---

Create a new network with Bridge driver:

```
docker network create --driver=bridge my-network
```

Verify it exists:

```
docker network inspect my-network
```

List of all networks:

```
docker network ls
```

---

When you launch a container into a network and use a name, other containers can access this container by name. For example, launch MongoDB from its official image at Docker Hub:

```
docker run --rm -it --net=my-network \
  --name mongod-banking-api-prod-container mongo
```

Verify that you have container in the network:

```
docker network inspect my-network
```

---

Copy the API image ID:

```
docker images
```


Run API container and use `mongod-banking-api-prod-container` as the hostname:

```
docker run --rm -t \
  --net=my-network --name banking-api \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DB_URI="mongodb://mongod-banking-api-prod-container:27017/db-prod" \
  -p 80:3000 be327d49c00d
```
